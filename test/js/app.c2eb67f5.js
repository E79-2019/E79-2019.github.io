Shortly thereafter, she joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University for a more empirical focus on data science while employing her visualization skills with Big Data. Zona’s accomplishments have garnered her an invitation to join the Visual Computing Group at Harvard\'s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), working as a postdoc visiting researcher on information visualization projects in augmented and virtual reality. Her skilled combination of data science and information design has allowed her to actively participate in projects with the Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS). Currently, she is teaching two courses at Harvard University and actively participate in research projects that combine information visualization and machine learning into an intelligent Web system. She is a COO and co-founder of ArchSpike, a platform that integrates data science with market modeling allowing users to design buildings that better respond to the future market demands."},{"type":"paragraph","title":"giulia zerbini — teaching fellow","text":"Giulia is a multidisciplinary designer from Italy specialised in data visualization.
