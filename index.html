          <h2>description</h2>
          <p>Complex data has brought into many visual forms in order to facilitate the content understanding. However, not every transformation turned out to be effective. To compose visual message and improve information communication, significant amount of design practice is needed. Information design course introduces the strategies of visual thinking as an efficient method to convey complex data. It covers the fundamentals of visual communication and apply design principles in the context of diverse media. Information design overlaps with another areas such as graphic design, communication design, data visualization, human- computer interaction design, and instructional design. The course combines the best practices from these intersections while focusing on the effectiveness and visual clarity.</p>

            <h2>course components</h2>
            <p>This course includes three major aspects of information visualization: graphics design, interaction design, and visual storytelling. First part of the course introduces students to design techniques as well as to the principles of effective visual communication. Second part of the course focuses on technologies, necessary to transfer designs into data-driven solutions. Before stepping into final projects, third part merges two perviously mentioned components into meaningful data visualization for further analysis and presentation.</p>
